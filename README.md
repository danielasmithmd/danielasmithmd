- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielasmithmd
- 👀 I’m interested in health statistics motivating individuals to change behavior: 
- It is known what your greatest risks are, 
- and it is known how best to reduce those risks,
- so let's put that in the palm of your hand!
- Personal identifying info not needed, just basics like age, gender, zip code. 
- Certainly there's profit directing customers to businesses. 
- But even if we don't get to $, there's the overall good to society: health education and health improvement.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/using google sheets, which works, but I don't have enough time to take the next steps. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who cringes at vast data NOT being coalesced into actionable "Aha!" moments. 
- 📫 How to reach me: danielasmithmd@gmail.com
- Here's what I've got so far: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p4ImKHy-FnUzTiqrtmfIR05GgIbs7Oww-1JlxAMAacE/edit?usp=sharing
